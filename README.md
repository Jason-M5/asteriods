# Asteroids Game

A classic Asteroids game built with Python and Pygame. Navigate your spaceship through an asteroid field, avoid collisions, and survive as long as possible!

## Features

- **Spaceship Control**: Rotate and move your triangular spaceship using keyboard controls
- **Asteroid Field**: Dynamic asteroid spawning from screen edges with random sizes and velocities
- **Collision Detection**: Circle-based collision detection between player and asteroids
- **Smooth Movement**: 60 FPS gameplay with delta time-based movement
- **Shooting System**: Fire shots to destroy asteroids (in development)

## Controls

- **A/D**: Rotate spaceship left/right
- **W/S**: Move forward/backward
- **Space**: Fire shots (in development)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13 or higher
- pip or uv package manager

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd asteriods
   ```

2. Install dependencies using uv:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

   Or using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame==2.6.1
   ```

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Game Configuration

The game settings can be modified in `constants.py`:

- **Screen**: 1280x720 resolution
- **Asteroids**: 3 different sizes (20-60 pixel radius)
- **Spawn Rate**: New asteroid every 0.8 seconds
- **Player**: 20 pixel radius, 200 speed, 300 turn speed
- **Shots**: 5 pixel radius, 500 speed
